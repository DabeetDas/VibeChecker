I initially started with total of 8 extra features + the one hot encoded column of subreddits
Shape of image input matrix - (1773, 955)
Shape of text input matrix - (3450, 955)

1. R2 (score): 0.8135791670162863
   R2 (num_coments): 0.28493274533608615

Now i am planning to add more features to improve score.

2. ADDED TWO NEW FEATURES - 
   avg_word_length_title and avg_word_length_body

   R2 (score): 0.8135560578194287
   R2 (num_coments): 0.28894868374219307

It changed almost negligible...

3. ADDED ONE MORE FEATURE - 
   Is question personal???

   R2 (score): 0.8135560578194287
   R2 (num_coments): 0.28894868374219307

But there is no change at all...  "CONCLUSION : ADDING A FEW EXTRA FEATURES MAKES NEGLIGIBLE CHANGE TO SCORE BEACUSE THERE ARE SO MANY FEATURES TAHT ONE-TWO NEW FEATURES ARE JUST IGNORED BY THE MODEL."
So i will either try hyperparameter tuning or make some changes to the model architecture now.

THE ABOVE THREE RESULTS WERE BY USING THEVOTING REGRESSOR 


NOW I SHIFTED TO STACKING REGRESSOR 


4. CHANGED SOME HYPER-PARAMETERS IN THE STACKING REGRESSOR MODEL
   a. changed the learning rate and so the number of trees (max_iter and n_estimator) of HGB and XGB respectively.
      (decreses the learning rate and inc the no. of trees)

   R2 (score): 0.9179
   R2 (num_coments): 0.3668

   The resulst imporve but the training was very slow. It took around 25 - 30 minutes each for the images and text datasets.

NOW I WILL CHECK RESULTS BY CHANGING HYPERPARAMETERS IN VOTING REGRESSOR
5.  a. I have changes the learning rate of both LGB and HGB from 0.03 to 0.01
    b. And increases the number of trees from 1000 to 3000.
    
     R2 (score): 0.8359
     R2 (num_coments): 0.3405

6. ADDED THE LOG TRANSFORM PART TO THE STACKING REGRESSOR
   R2 (score): 0.8909
   R2 (num_coments): 0.4356     
   Comments improved but score decreased.

7. a. Changing cv from 3 to 5 in stacking regressor.
   b. Lowering the learning rate from 0.01 to 0.005 and therefore increasing number of trees. 
      
   Caused both scores to decrease so i changed it back.  


   FINALLY T AM GOING WITH SCORE IN POINT 6 
   R2 (score): 0.8909
   R2 (num_coments): 0.4356
